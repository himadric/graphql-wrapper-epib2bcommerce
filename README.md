# GraphQL Wrapper for Episerver B2B Commerce by Insite

## Introduction
This is an experimental project that I wished to work on for quite some time but couldn't make much time through 2020 with a busy schedule. Finally, I could make time at the end of the year. Is it complete? Not at all. It's not meant to be a complete project (I said experimental, right?). The purpose of the project is to show 'how we can take existing Insite RestApis and produce GraphQL endpoints from them'. 
InsiteCommerce was acquired by Episerver this year released their latest frontend called Spire built on React. Insite was going to release GraphQL APIs but, for some reason pushed it back. The GraphQL APIs will be a much better fit than RestAPIs for Spire. I hope it will be released soon. In the meantime, if someone wants to use graphQL endpoints for Insite wrapping up the RestApis is an option.
